# ðŸ“ˆ Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution to develop strategies for improving future campaigns. By leveraging exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques, specifically using the XGBoost classifier, we aim to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various demographic and campaign-related features.

## Dataset Description

The dataset provides information on the marketing campaigns conducted by the bank, which were primarily based on phone calls. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit after a marketing contact.

### What is a Term Deposit?

A **Term Deposit** is a bank investment where a sum of money is deposited for a fixed period at a predetermined interest rate. Funds are locked in until the term ends, offering higher interest rates compared to regular savings accounts. It's considered a low-risk investment with guaranteed returns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Comprehensive EDA was performed to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and detect anomalies. The following steps were undertaken:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and addressed missing or null values in the dataset.
2. **Univariate Analysis**: Explored individual features to understand their distributions using histograms and box plots.
3. **Bivariate Analysis**: Analyzed relationships between features and the target variable using bar plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
4. **Outlier Detection**: Detected outliers in numerical features using interquartile range (IQR) and visualized them through box plots.
5. **Feature Distribution**: Examined the distribution of categorical and numerical features.
6. **Data Balance Check**: Checked for class imbalance in the target variable and considered techniques for addressing any imbalance detected.

**Key Insights from EDA**:

- Certain job types and education levels showed higher subscription rates to term deposits.
- Features like `Call_Duration` and `Previous_outcome` had strong correlations with the likelihood of subscribing.
- Some features contained outliers that could affect model performance if not addressed.
- The dataset exhibited a moderate class imbalance, with more instances of clients not subscribing to term deposits.

## Feature Engineering

To enhance model performance, several feature engineering techniques were applied:

1. **Dropping Irrelevant Features**: Removed features that did not contribute significantly to the prediction task.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Imputed missing values using appropriate strategies (e.g., mode for categorical variables).
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Applied one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format suitable for modeling.
4. **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features using techniques like Min-Max scaling to normalize the data.
5. **Outlier Treatment**: Addressed outliers by capping and flooring based on percentiles or removing them entirely.
6. **Feature Creation**: Created new features by combining existing ones to capture additional information (e.g., interaction terms).

**Result of Feature Engineering**:

- The processed dataset had improved data quality with reduced noise and variability.
- The transformed features were more suitable for feeding into machine learning algorithms, leading to better model performance.

## Modeling

Two machine learning algorithms were evaluated to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit:

1. **Random Forest Classifier**
2. **XGBoost Classifier**

### Model Evaluation

- **Cross-Validation**: Performed 5-fold cross-validation to assess model performance and generalizability.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employed grid search and random search methods to optimize model hyperparameters.

**Model Selection**:

- The **XGBoost Classifier** outperformed the Random Forest Classifier across all performance metrics.
- **XGBoost** demonstrated better handling of class imbalance and provided more precise predictions.

### Training the Final Model

- Trained the optimized XGBoost model on the full training dataset.
- **Feature Importance**: Plotted feature importance scores to interpret and understand the influence of each feature on predictions.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: The final XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of **85.66%** on the test dataset.
- **Precision**: High precision indicates a low false positive rate in predictions.
- **Recall**: Satisfactory recall suggests the model effectively identifies clients who will subscribe.
- **ROC-AUC Score**: The model achieved a strong ROC-AUC score, indicating excellent discriminative ability.

**Interpretation**:

The model effectively predicts client subscription to term deposits, providing valuable insights for tailoring marketing strategies. Features like `Call_Duration`, `Previous_outcome`, and `Age` were among the top contributors to the model's predictions.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to improve bank marketing campaign outcomes. By identifying key factors influencing client decisions, the bank can:

- **Optimize Targeting**: Focus efforts on demographics and profiles more likely to subscribe.
- **Enhance Communication**: Adjust contact strategies (e.g., timing, method) based on insights.
- **Improve Resource Allocation**: Allocate marketing resources more efficiently to maximize return on investment.
