# ðŸ“ˆ Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution to develop strategies for improving future campaigns. By leveraging exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques, specifically using the XGBoost classifier, we aim to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various demographic and campaign-related features.

## Dataset Description

The dataset provides information on the marketing campaigns conducted by the bank, which were primarily based on phone calls. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit after a marketing contact.

### What is a Term Deposit?

A **Term Deposit** is a bank investment where a sum of money is deposited for a fixed period at a predetermined interest rate. Funds are locked in until the term ends, offering higher interest rates compared to regular savings accounts. It's considered a low-risk investment with guaranteed returns.
